            <p>     For this assignment I picked the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Flatiron-School-Bay-Area-Coding-Community/events/267239087/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Create Your Own Video Game 
                with JavaScript: Workshop</a> by <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Flatiron-School-Bay-Area-Coding-Community/">Flatiron school MeetUP Group </a>
                they are a local coding boot camp. This event was a free lecture on how to write a simple javascript videogame using Canvas. Canvas is an
                visual display / vector drawing tool built into modern webbrowsers, and it used in a number HTML5 webapps.       
                            
            </p>
            <p>
                    There first let us in at 6pm, openning with free sandwhiches and beer, giving us about half an hour to eat a socialize before the demo
                part of the meetup begain. At which point our instructor for the evening Levi Miller walked us back to one of the lecture rooms.
                Before getting into the technocial instruction Levi showed us the finshed verison of the game he was going to teach us how to code.
                The game was quite simple, you control a small space ship and can shoot missiles. The goal of the game is to put out missiles and avoid being
                hit by said missiles. The more missiles you can put out without them hitting you the higher your score.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the next couple of hours Levi walked through line by line as he recoded the massteroids game he had just demoed. Drawing the ship, and the missiles
                making the screan wrap around, which involed doing some triomnitey. How the clear the screan and control refresh rate, but the one thing we ran out of time for
                was collisons, so the code along verison wasn't quite finsh.
            </p>
            <p>
                All in all I had a great time and learn a lot about using the Canvas api with JavaScript and made some new friends in the process.
                One thing that I thought to myself was how similar the vector drawing Canvas is to drawing in JavaFX.
